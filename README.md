  ## Setting Up Your Desktop Environment with Configurations                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
  To set up your desktop environment using the provided scripts and configuration files, follow these steps:                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
  ### Step 1: Install Required Programs                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
  1. Run the  install_programs.sh  script to install the necessary programs ( kitty ,  i3 ,  eh , and  tty-clock ) on your Arch Linux system. Make sure the script has execution permissions by running  chmod +x  
  install_programs.sh . Execute the script using  ./install_programs.sh .                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
  ### Step 2: Copy Configuration Files                                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
  1. After installing the programs, copy the configuration files from the  DTConfig  directory to the respective configuration directories in your home directory ( $HOME/.config  or other relevant directories). 
  2. Update the configuration files in your original configuration directory with your preferred settings.                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
  ### Step 3: Configure Programs                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
  1. Customize the configuration files in the original configuration directories to tailor the programs ( kitty ,  i3 ,  eh ) to your specific preferences. Make any necessary adjustments to achieve your desired 
  desktop environment setup.                                                                                                                                                                                       
  2. Ensure that the configurations are correctly set up for each program to match your workflow and aesthetic preferences.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
  ### Step 4: Test and Enjoy                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
  1. Restart or reload the desktop environment using `(mod+shift+r)` to apply the new configurations.                                                                                                                                    
  2. Test the setup of your desktop environment to ensure that everything is working as expected.                                                                                                                  
  3. Enjoy your personalized desktop environment with the configurations and programs set up according to your preferences.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
  By following these steps and focusing on running the  `install_programs.sh`  script and copying the configuration files from  DTConfig  to your home directory, you can efficiently set up your desktop environment
  with the desired configurations and programs. If you have any questions or encounter issues during the setup process, feel free to ask for assistance. 
 
 Additionally, to copy the latest configurations to the DTConfig  directory by running `sh  copy_configs.sh` script.
